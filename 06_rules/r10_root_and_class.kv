## This demostrates how (and why) to import
## a .py script into a .kv file. With custom classes
## defined in r10_class_definitions, we can better organize
## our code. Our call to Builder.load_file() doesn't have to
## follow custom class definitions in the main .py file because
## those definitions have been moved to their own file.
##
## This is what these import statements would look like in Python:
##		from r06_class_definitions import RootObj
##		from r06_class_definitions import MyButton
##
## NOTE: Unlike in Python where multiple modules can be comma-separated
## and imported all in one statement, only one module can be named per statement.

#:import RootObj custom.r10_rootobj_definition
#:import MyButton r10_mybutton_definition

RootObj:

<RootObj>:
	BoxLayout:
		MyButton:
			text: "one"
		MyButton:
			text: "two"
		MyButton:
			text: "three"

<MyButton>:
	background_color: (1, 0, 0, 1)
	text: "abutton"
