## Example of realigning text on a button.
##
## Just setting halign/valign won't be enough.
## By default, Kivy sets text_size to the size of
## the actual text, not the widget containing the
## text. To get text to move toward any edge of 
## the widget, change the widget's text_size property
## to match the size of the widget (text_size: self.size).
## To get padding between the edge of the widget and
## the text, use self.width and self.height and subtract
## a bit where you want the padding (see below).
## Usually, text_size is set to self.size,
## but in this case, I wanted the width
## a bit smaller so the text isn't right
## up against the edge of the button.

MyButton:

<MyButton@Button>:
	text: "Push Me, Baby"
	on_release: print("Give it to me, baby!")
	italic: True
	font_size: 60
	text_size: (self.width - 40, self.height)
	halign: "right"
	valign: "middle"
	color: [126/255, 45/255, 210/255, 1]
	background_color: [130/255, 180/255, 10/255, 1]
	background_normal: ""
