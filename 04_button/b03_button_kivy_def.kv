## basic button defined here instead of in the .py file
## BEWARE
## If the root rule is omitted, the script will run and no
## error will be thrown, but the button won't appear.
## Tricky stuff.
## However, using both a root and class rule here effectively
## moves the entire definition of MyButton out of the Python script.
## But, it also means that MyButton is the one and only widget
## in our app.

MyButton:

<MyButton@Button>:
	text: "Push Me, Baby"
	on_release: print("Give it to me, baby!")
	italic: True
