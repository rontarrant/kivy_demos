## Demo of placing a Label that's half the size
## of the BoxLayout. All that's needed is to 
## set a size_hint for Label as seen below.
##
## This is also a demo of left-aligning a half-sized
## Label. Since this is the default, no action is needed.
<MyBoxLayout>:
	orientation: "vertical"
	spacing: 20
	padding: 20
	##size: root.width, root.height

	Label:
		id: my_label
		text: "Here's a label"
		font_size: 32
		size_hint: .5, 1
		canvas.before:
			Color:
				rgba: 0, 0, 1, 1
			Rectangle:
				pos: self.pos
				size: self.size
	Button:
		id: my_button
		text: "Next Label"
		font_size: 32
		size_hint: (1, 1)
		on_release: root.release()
