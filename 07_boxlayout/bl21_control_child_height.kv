# example 1-7 Setting widget sizes on AddLocationForm
## This is a reconstruction of Example 1-7 from the O'Reilly
## book, "Creating Apps in Kivy (2014)". Because ListView
## is deprecated, I've substituted a ScrollView. To simplify,
## I've stuffed a populated BoxLayout into the ScrollView.
##
## General Notes on Layout
##
## To stop widgets from using all the available space,
## we need to do two things:
## 1) turn off size_hint'ing for either x, y, or both,
## 2) set a specific height, width, or both, and
## 3) Then decide what percentage of the available area
##    we want each item/row/column to take up.
##
## Row 1 and Row 2 both have explicitly-set heights. This allows
## Row 3—which doesn't have an explicitly-set height—to
## expand to take up all the rest of the available height.
## Note:
## Widths are all controled by relative size hints in the
## x direction. In Row 1 and Row 3, the widths of the Buttons
## are all set to 25 (implying 25%) while the TextInputs
## are set to 50 (implying 50%).
